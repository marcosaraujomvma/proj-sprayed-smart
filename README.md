# Tractor Spraying Monitoring Project

## General Objectives

Tractor spraying is a crucial tool for rural producers in combating pests and diseases. In order to optimize the effectiveness of this process, it is essential to ensure that the entire area is properly sprayed, even during nighttime hours when weather conditions are more favorable. The main objective of this project is to ensure that spraying is carried out comprehensively and efficiently, maximizing its effectiveness in pest control.

## Specific Objectives

This project has the following specific objectives:

- Ensure that the tractor driver performs spraying within the programmed geographical perimeter;
- Measure the time spent per street during spraying;
- Monitor input consumption during spraying operations;
- Verify that spraying nozzles are operating at the correct flow rate;
- Detect and correct possible clogging in spraying nozzles.

## Technologies Used

To achieve the proposed objectives, the following technologies are employed:

- Distance and GPS positioning sensors to ensure correct area spraying and monitor time spent per street;
- Flow and pressure sensors to monitor input consumption and spraying nozzle flow rate;
- Platforms such as Elasticsearch and Kibana for data analysis and visualization;
- Devices like the Raspberry Pi to host sensors and process data.

## Testing and Validation

To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the project, tests and validations were conducted using the PlataformIO IDE platform. These tests allowed verifying the correct operation of the sensors and the integration code with hardware devices.
